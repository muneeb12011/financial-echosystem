# Financial Ecosystem Project

## Overview
The Financial Ecosystem Project is designed to manage and distribute funds efficiently through a combination of amplification, escrow management, and seamless integration with PayPal. This system automates the payment process, ensuring high precision in financial calculations and reliable transaction handling.

## Features
- **Escrow Management:** Holds funds in escrow and releases them based on predefined thresholds.
- **Vortex Amplification:** Amplifies contributions exponentially over time to increase fund availability.
- **Multithreading Support:** Executes payments concurrently to enhance operational efficiency.
- **PayPal Integration:** Securely sends payments using the PayPal API, with built-in retry logic for failed transactions.
- **Webhook Listener:** Receives and validates incoming payment notifications from PayPal to ensure accurate tracking.
- **High Precision Calculations:** Utilizes the Decimal module for precise financial calculations, avoiding floating-point issues.
I attach webhook listner in vortex_amplification.py
- **Automatic Payment Distribution:** Automates payments from the BlackDoor system to specified endpoints.

   cd financial_ecosystem
Install the required packages:

pip install requests
Configuration
Before running the application, update the following constants in vortex_amplification.py with your PayPal client ID and secret:


PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = 'ARB5HqrvzFFRgPnWAmKmWqM5QqwnaIednJX3xekgw_5I-PGCQA8rylX0wgZF-KF696y87eK601ZZeNtg'
PAYPAL_SECRET = 'ELiojntr74xZnpUwkZqDuA6rsAIXvQ6HB3Ks3EbeG1pnZauA6JI4KDTNw6aFajPu3rasyYd8i3KGtXFS'
Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:


python main.py
You can adjust the initial_contribution variable in vortex_amplification.py to set your desired starting amount for amplification.

Logging
The system logs transactions and errors for monitoring purposes. Check the console output for details on payment status and other events.

Testing
Run the tests to ensure functionality and reliability:

Payment Process Flow
Vortex Amplification: Contributions are amplified exponentially over a specified duration.
Escrow Management: Amplified funds are held in escrow until they surpass a predefined threshold.
Payment Execution: Once the threshold is reached, payments are distributed to the specified endpoints (PayPal only).
Webhook Listener: Listens for incoming payments and validates them against the defined business rules.
Webhook Listener
The system includes a webhook listener to receive notifications about incoming payments, ensuring real-time tracking and validation of transactions.
